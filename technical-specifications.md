# Technical specifications

This article is about the technical requirements for Hexlet lessons and courses. For non-technical specifications, please refer to [Conceptual specifications for lessons](conceptual-specifications.md).

## Video

* Accepted formats: MOV, QT, OGG, MPEG, AVI.
* Minimum resolution: 1280x720 (720p).
* In case of a screencast, do not record a huge screen, limit to standard 13", 15" or 17".
* Audio should be noise free. We suggest using an external USB microphone. Logitec USB headsets are usually good enough. We could also recommend "Rode Podcaster", "Blue Microphones", "Snowball" and "Samson C01U".
* Any text, including code that you might show in your IDE, should be large enough to see. Regular font-size for programming is not large enough for video, so make sure you increase the font size. 
* Provide all source files: video, sound (if recorded separately), slides (PowerPoint, Keynote or Google Presentations), images.

## Text

* Our editor accepts markdown. Make sure your text is finely formatted. Do not use header 1 for headers, only smaller ones.
* Please, run your texts through a spell checker. For Russian we recommend [Yandex's spell checker](https://tech.yandex.ru/speller/). For English, check out [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/).
* Images should be uploaded to imgur.com.
* Provide additional text for each theory step (at least links for further reading) and transcript of the video with main points. Users shoud be able to remember important parts of your video by reading this transcript and without re-watching video itself.
* Code should be wrapped in triple backticks, with language specified like so:

## Slides

* Your slides should mainly use the same language your whole courses uses. 

## Exercise specifications

* It should normally take no more than 30 minutes to complete the exercise.
* If there are many steps in a single challenge exercise, think about splitting it into multiple exercises or even multiple lessons altogether.
