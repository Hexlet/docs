# Technical specifications

This article is about the technical requirements for Hexlet lessons. For non-technical specifications, please refer to [Conceptual specifications for lessons](conceptual-specifications.md).

## Video

* Accepted formats: MOV, QT, OGG, MPEG, AVI.
* Minimum resolution: 1280x720 (720p),﻿
* If it's a screencast, do not record a huge screen, limit to standard 13", 15" or 17".
* Make sure the audio doesn't have much noise. We suggest using an external USB-mic. Logitec USB headsets are usually good. Alternatively, you can go with a separate USB-mic. We recommend Rode podcaster, Blue mic Snowball and Samson c01u﻿.
* Any text, including code that you might show in your IDE, should be large enough to see. Regular font-size for programming is not large enough for video, so make sure you increase the font size.
* Provide all source files: video, sound (if recorded separately), slides (PowerPoint, Keynote or Google Presentations), images.

## Text

* Our editor accepts markdown. Make sure your text is finely formatted. Do not use header 1 for headers, only smaller ones.
* If you want to include images, upload them to imgur.com.
* If you want to include code, wrap it between triple backticks and specify the language like so:

## Challenge specifications

* It should normally take no more than 2 hours to complete the challenge.
* If there are many steps in a single challenge exercise, think about splitting it into multiple exercises or even multiple lessons altogether.
